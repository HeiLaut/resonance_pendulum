I would like to have an easy-to-use resonance experiment for my physics class. The Pohl’s wheel was too expensive for this purpose, so I built my own version, heavily inspired by the original and mostly 3D-printed.

They have the following features in common:

- a rotational pendulum

- an electric motor as the excitation source


Differences:

- no eddy-current brake

- a plastic spring

- ball bearings to reduce friction

- damping present from the beginning
