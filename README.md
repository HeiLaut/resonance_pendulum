I'd like to have an easy to use resonance experiment for my physics class. The "Pohlsches Rad" (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlsches_Rad) was to expemsive for this purpose. So I made my own one, heavyly inspired by the original and **mostly 3d printed**.

they have in common:
  - rotation pendulum
  - electric motor excitation source

difference:
 - no eddy current break
 - plastic spring
 - ball bearings for friction reduction
 - damped from the beginning
